This is my first jekyll theme decorated by my favorite items -- blue and ice bear. It's welcomed to give me a star at github if you like it.

### Installation

* Fork the [repo](https://github.com/songkong/Blog/tree/gh-pages).
* Edit `_config.yml` file.
* Edit `About me` content in `index.html`.
* Add your own `projects` in `_includes/projects.html`.
* Change `domain name` in `CNAME`.
* Add your own `disqus` code in `_includes/comments.html`.
* The last two scripts in `assets/js/script.js` offer Google Analytics and Baidu Analytics. You can replace them with your own codes.
